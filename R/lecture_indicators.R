# ---- Controlling for party (with a dummy variable) -----------------------

# new_variable = case_when(if condition ~ result if TRUE,
#                          if condition2 ~ result if TRUE)
house <- house %>%
  mutate(republican = case_when(party == "Republican" ~ 1,

# use `+` to add additional predictors to the regression
reg_party <- lm(nominate_dim1 ~ rep_pvote + republican,
                data = house)

tidy(reg_party)


# ---- Bonus lesson on "how well the model fits" -----------------------

# use the glance function to look at model-level summaries

# first model, ideology ~ presvote
glance(house_reg)

# second model, ideology ~ presvote + party
glance(reg_party)


# Compare the adj.r.squared values.
# R^2 is a measure of model fit. 
# It measures the "proportion of the variation in Y" that is explained by X.
# R^2 = 1.0 would be a perfect prediction.
# R^2 = 0 would be a useless prediction.
# Any time you add variables to a model, 
#   you increase R^2 even due to randomness. But "adjusted R^2" is 
#   meant to penalize the inclusion of additional variables. 
#   If adding another variable to the model increases the "adjusted R^2," 
#   then the model is explaining more of Y.
#   As always, "explaining" just means "stronger correlation." 
#   It doesn't tell us about causality.



# ---- Generate model predictions -----------------------

# ---- Multi-category example -----------------------

# car data

                        cyl != 6 ~ 0),

                          cyl != 8 ~ 0)
  ) %>%
  print()


# but when we do the car model, we have to leave a category omitted
car_model <- lm(mpg ~ six_cyl + eight_cyl, data = mtcars)

tidy(car_model)

# generate model predictions
# augment() the model
# since all 4, 6, and 8 cylinder cars have the same prediction in the model,
# let's just reduce the data using summarize()
car_data <- car_model %>%
  augment() %>%
  group_by(six_cyl, eight_cyl) %>%
  summarize(fitted = unique(.fitted)) %>% 
  print()

# omitted category is 4 cylinders
# when six_cyl == 0 and eight_cyl == 0, that car has 4 cylinders 
# coefficients of car_model show the *difference* in mpg compared to 4 cyl





# ---- Dummies for VARYING SLOPES (Interaction terms) --------------


# create interaction term: (pvote * republican)

# coefficients mean:
# (Intercept): intercept (when republican == 0)
# rep_pvote: slope on presidential vote (when republican == 0)
# republican: intercept shift compared to republican == 0
# interact_vote_rep: slope shift compared to republican == 0


# generate model predictions
