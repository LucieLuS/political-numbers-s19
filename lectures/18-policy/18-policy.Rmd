### Policy "problems"

Are data in context?

What's causing the problem?

What policy could address that mechanism?

.pull-right[
### Policy "solutions"

Has the policy been implemented elsewhere?

Is there evidence that the policy works? How do you know?

Can the evidence be *generalized?*

What if the policy hasn't been enacted anywhere else?

# Voter Identification Requirements

.pull-left[
### Problem? Election security

- Are there fraudulent ballots? 
- Voters have shaky confidence that votes are counted as intended


### Solution? Tighter ID requirements

- Bills, bank statements, birth certificates, SS cards not good enough
- Student photo ID? Not good enough (no signature)
- Wisconsin: must have photo and a signature

### Do voter ID requirements reduce turnout?

Unit of analysis: states (state-years)

Independent variable: state has voter ID law (1) or not (0)

Dependent variable: turnout rate (% VEP)

### Confounding and selection bias

There's something about states ( $U$ ) that make them adopt voter ID requirements ( $X$ )

Is that something related to turnout ( $Y$ ) also?

We should compare states *against themselves*

## Difference-in-differences

Background characteristics

Difference 1: difference over time

Difference 2: are treatment and control changes the same?

Counterfactuals


\begin{align}
  \hat{y} &= a + b_{1}\left(\mathrm{Treat}\right) + b_{2}\left(\mathrm{After}\right) + \\ 
  &\quad b_{3}\left(\mathrm{Treat \times After}\right)
\end{align}

## Understanding the Diff-in-diff model

\begin{align}
  \hat{y} &= a + b_{1}\left(\mathrm{Treat}\right) + b_{2}\left(\mathrm{After}\right) + \\ 
  &\quad b_{3}\left(\mathrm{Treat \times After}\right)
\end{align}

Control group, before treatment (after = 0, treat = 0): $a$

Treatment group, before treatment (after = 0, treat = 1): $a + b_{1}$

Control group, after treatment (after = 1, treat = 0): $a + b_{2}$

Treatment group, after treatment (after = 1, treat = 1): $a + b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3}$

--

** $b_{3}$ is the effect of treatment, controlling for over-time change ( $b_{2}\mathrm{After}$ ) and background characteristics of the treatment and control groups ( $b_{1}\mathrm{Treat}$ ) **


---

## With real data


\begin{align}
  \hat{\mathrm{turnout}} &= a + d_{\mathit{year}} + d_{\mathit{states}} + b\left(\mathrm{ID.Law}\right)
\end{align}

.left-code[

```{r}
turnout_data <- select(to, -midterm)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
turnout_data
```

.right-plot[

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# within lm(), as.factor() makes a sequence of dummies
# one category is automatically omitted (alphanumerically)
diff_diff <- 
  lm(turnout ~ strict_id + as.factor(state) + as.factor(year),
     data = filter(turnout_data)) 
```
]


---

.left-code[
```{r summary, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
summary(diff_diff)
```

Each state/year effect is comparison to omitted category (Alabama or 1980)

e.g. CA is (on avg) 2% higher turnout than AL

Turnout in 2008 was (on avg) 7 pts higher than 1980

Turnout under voter ID is (on avg) 1.2 pts higher (not sig.)

## Exogenous vs endogenous policy change

Policy change comes from within the system (endogenous)

Policy change is imposed from external forces (exogenous)

**Exogenous policy change are easier to study**

# Looking ahead

On Wednesday: 

- experiments (and ethics)

- Discuss in-section presentation


Section:

- More multiple regression


Next week:

- Big data (by Michael)

- Elections, campaigns, polls...
