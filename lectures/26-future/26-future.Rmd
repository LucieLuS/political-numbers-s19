Academia: biases toward novelty & significance for publication

Politics, policy, advocacy, industry: quest for "good enough" can sacrifice rigor or [interpretability](https://twitter.com/dvIpr/status/1092780446843162625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Peer review isn't fool-proof

[Publication bias](https://xkcd.com/882/
) (many findings are false or over-estimated)

$p$-hacking, "Dichotomania," Garden of Forking Paths, HARKing

Null hypothesis testing and the [philosophy of science](https://xkcd.com/2078/)

> "This study documents reporting errors in a sample of over 250,000 p-values reported in eight major psychology journals from 1985 until 2013, using the new R package `statcheck`. `statcheck` retrieved null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) results from over half of the articles from this period. In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom."

### "Dynamic" Reporting (e.g. Rmarkdown)

Integrates code & writing; output matches analysis

Content control (similar to $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$)

([Get started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) or take a [deep dive](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/))

(Or, turn all your work [into code](https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/plain-person-text.pdf))

## Git

Version control (like "track changes" but for code)

Edit code incrementally, "commit" changes

Rewind project history, branch off, merge branches

*VERY* important for data science (collaboration, complex projects)

## Statistical(?) Technology

Larger samples (statistical power)

Causal inference with potential outcomes

- Minimal requisite assumptions to identify "treatment effect"

- Unit $i$ receives treatment ($z = 1$) or control ($z = 0$)

- $y(z)$: outcome value given $z$

- Treatment effect is $y(z = 1)_{i} - y(z = 0)_{i}$

Bayesian statistical analysis

Big $ in your future

Formal and informal structures for behaviors, customs, rules, processes

What is a **collective action problem**?

Scientific work is like a *market*. How do you change market behavior?

## Journal reforms

Open Access

Short papers

Replication data and code (["Data Access and Research Transparency" Initiative](https://www.dartstatement.org/))

But...exploratory vs confirmatory research?

Replication, still largely a thankless task

Give people motivation to change (institutions)

### Science, math, statistics, ethics

### Not to mention...subject-matter expertise

### Luckily, it's fun to learn & challenge yourself
