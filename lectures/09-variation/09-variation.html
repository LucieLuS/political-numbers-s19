## Essay 1

Overall great!

Feedback:

- Commit to a measure
- Direction of relationship
- Avoid "proving" and "disproving"
- Contamination of the DV
- Please proofread!

My bad:

- Latent probability vs incidence (e.g. of war)

## Let's talk about papers

Original research question

- Does `\(X\)` affect `\(Y\)`?
- What other things might affect `\(Y\)` (at least two other potential explainers)? Use theoretical reasoning

Collect data (at least 50 cases)

Write a 12-page paper (not counting graphics)

- What's the question
- Theory and hypotheses
- Explain your data and method
- Analysis (graphics and regression analysis)
- Conclusion and potential improvements

???

- In a given sample, I am randomly inaccurate, and that is to be expected.
  - Every time I call someone, there's a 54% chance they support A, so there's randomness
  - When randomness is at play, you get uncertainty


- It looks like it's getting wider, but it isn't.
- That's just random variation

## Reality is clumpy

Flip a coin. Probability of heads is `\(0.5\)`.

--

Flip a coin twice. Probability of two heads in a row is `\(0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25\)`

--

Flip a coin `\(n\)` times. Probability of `\(n\)` heads in a row is `\(0.5^{n}\)`.

--

**I flip a coin 1000 times**. What's the longest sequences of heads I get?

--




```r
# I ran this simulation in R
max(one_thousand_flips$heads_in_a_row)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

Wow! The probability of getting that many heads in a row is `\(0.5^{10} = 0.0009766\)`!

## 10,000 Independent Polls


???

Why 10,000?

- reality is clumpy
- but it's clumpy when you look up close
- when you zoom out really far, clumpiness cancels out (randomly)

**bee swarm**

- if we were to zoom in, we would see that every poll is different
- Every poll is off a little bit
- but overall, they're close to the truth
- It looks like the farther you get from the truth, the fewer polls are out there


**Distribution of outcomes**

- We're going to look at a histogram
- similar to a bar chart
- it the distribution of the data
  - where are the data

--

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="09-variation_files/figure-html/hist-polls-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

???

**Holy shit**

- How did this happen?
- Every poll is a little bit random
  - for every person who picks up the phone, there's a 54% change that they support candidate A
  - so not everyone who picks up the phone is the same
  - and sometimes you get clumpiness in a survey
- but the clumpiness in one survey is unrelated to the clumpiness in other surveys
  - Most surveys have some clumpiness, so they're a little off
  - Fewer surveys have *lots of clumpiness*, but it's less likely to have lots of clumpiness
  - That's why some surveys are *really* off, but there aren't as many of those

### The normal distribution

.left-code[
If some variable `\(Y\)` is affected (at least in part) by an accumulation of random fluctuations, then *the distribution of `\(Y\)`* will be approx. normal

**A "draw" from a normal distribution:** Any *individual* observation of `\(y\)` is just one number, but the probability of observing that value (relative to the mean) is given by the normal distribution

For example, one random draw:


```
## [1] 0.547
```

## Accumulating fluctuations

If some outcome is the result of an *accumulation of random fluctuations*, then the outcome is normally distributed (as the number of fluctuations `\(\rightarrow \infty\)`)

## What do "accumulating fluctuations" have to do with the mean

or, "Why are means normally distributed?"

`\begin{align}
  \bar{x} &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}
\end{align}`

--

Summing the data is "adding up fluctuations." **Cool, huh!**

# How we use the normal distribution in statistics

## "The sampling distribution of `\(\bar{x}\)` is normal"

.left-code[
This means "the sample mean is a *normal draw* from the true mean".

**How accurate is the mean?**

What's the dispersion in the raw data? Calculate the *standard deviation* of data `\(x\)`:
`\begin{align}
  s(x) = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i}^{n}(x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{n - 1}}
\end{align}`

**Standard deviation** is the "average distance between a data point and `\(\bar{x}\)`"

Data `\(x\)` where `\(\bar{x} = 10\)`

- normal draw, meaning, it's a single number, but it's more likely to appear in the center of the distribution and less likely to appear in the tail
- We don't know where the true mean is, but we know enough about the properties of the Normal distribution that we can build an informed guess
  - we know that most

## "The sampling distribution of `\(\bar{x}\)` is normal"

.left-code[

**Standard error** is "average error between `\(\bar{x}\)` and the true mean `\(\mu\)`"

Standard error of `\(\bar{x}\)`:
`\begin{align}
  se(\bar{x}) &amp;= \frac{s(x)}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{align}`

Rules for averages:

- ~ 68% of estimates are within `\(\pm\)` 1 std. error from "true" value
- ~ 95% of estimates are within `\(\pm\)` 2 std. errors 
- more than 99% of estimates are within `\(\pm\)` 3 std. errors

# Statistics is about dealing with *uncertainty* in real data

### Here is how most people do statistics

Every sample is an *imperfect* representation of the underlying population

Calculate a sample estimate (such as a mean) and its standard error

Most of the time, your estimate is within `\(\pm\)` 2 standard errors from the  "true value"






???

Lots of statistics depend on assumptions about the "distribution" of our data

- a lot of these assumptions are like, assuming that our estimate of the mean is normally distributed
- or assuming that our data are normally distributed

It often feels like this is a tenuous assumption, that could easily be broken

- it is actually hard to break, because it isn't fragile
- The normal distribution is just what happens when you add lots of fluctuations together
- and lots of things are influenced by lots of small fluctuations

&lt;!-- 
Lessons

- data have randomness, you don't know how accurate you've been
- clumping happens
- randomness looks uneven when you zoom in
- randomness looks even when you zoom (way) out
- simulate normal (CLT)
- simulate means, they're normal
- Where to introduce concepts:
  - std deviation: how much noise in my data
  - std error: how (in)accurate is my estimate (in expectation)?
