# Exercise 1

class: center

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = "80%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "googling.png"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "80%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "changing.png"))
```
]

**Practice (and modify) old material. Write fresh code. Use notes and internet.**


???

- The pain is the learning
  - If you feel confused, it is only because you are trying to understand
- it should have been a grind but made sense at the end
  - you should notice it coming together somewhat
- 



- The expectation is that this is a bit of a grind at first, but it makes sense by the end
- if you feel like it isn't making sense, keep practicing the material we've given you so far
  - don't just run code, type it out yourself
  - try to modify code to see what it does
  - try to re-create things using different data
- Or, check out the materials that are in the syllabus
  - I picked those out because they are companions to the things we're learning about in class
  - Maybe they explain something in some way that you find more helpful

# Relationships

# $X$ and $Y$

.left-code[
As $x$ increases, $y$ does what?

Does $y$ change when $x$ changes?
]

.right-plot[
```{r midwest-1, out.width = "80%", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
mwplot_1 <- 
  ggplot(midwest, aes(x = percollege, y = percbelowpoverty)) +

## Positive and Negative Relationships

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "60%"}
tibble(X = rnorm(100, 0, 1),
       Positive = X + rnorm(100, 0, 1),

    geom_point(color = "steelblue") +

### Relationships among Categorical Variables

```{r profs, fig.show = 'hide', echo = TRUE}
prof_degrees <- midwest %>%
  group_by(state, inmetro) %>%
  summarize(prof = mean(percprof)) %>%
  mutate(
    metro = ifelse(inmetro == 1, 
                   "Metro Area", 
                   "Non-Metro Area")

## A Mathematical Language for Relationships

---

class: center, middle

## $\mathrm{E}\left[ Y \right]$



???

Review intuition of expectation



---

class: center, middle

## $\mathrm{E}\left[ Y \mid X \right]$


"Expected $Y$, given $X$"



---

## $\mathrm{E}\left[ Y \mid X \right]$


.left-code[
Relationship means the expectation is changing

- Within sample: almost always some non-zero relationship
- Inference to the population: an we infer that our expectation should change in the real world?
]

.right-plot[
```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
tibble(x = rnorm(100, 0, 1),
       y = 0.5*x + rnorm(100, 0, 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Independence (no relationship)

### $\mathrm{E}\left[Y\right] = \mathrm{E}\left[ Y \mid X \right]$

#### "Knowing $X$ doesn't affect my expectation of $Y$"


???

Every $y$ value corresponds to an $x$

- $y$ has some expected value
- does knowing $x$ change what we expect out of $y$?




---

class: center, middle

## Dependence

### $\mathrm{E}\left[Y\right] \neq \mathrm{E}\left[ Y \mid X \right]$

#### "Knowing $X$ would change my expectation of $Y$"




---

## Correlation

```{r out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "rvals.png"))
```



---

## Common relationships

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2.5}
rels <- tibble(
  x = seq(-4, 4, .01),
  linear = 0.6 * x,
  polynomial = -2 + x - x^2,
  logarithmic = log(x),
  exponential = exp(x),
  logistic = plogis(x)
) %>%
  gather(key = form, value = y, -x) %>%
  mutate(form = fct_relevel(form, "linear", "polynomial", "exponential", "logarithmic", "logistic"))

ggplot(rels, aes(x, y)) +
  facet_wrap(~ form, scales = "free",
             nrow = 1) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue")
```


<!-- Use math:
  linear, 
  logarithmic, 
  exponential, 
  polynomial, 
  logistic -->

# Finding $y_{i}$

.pull-left[
$y_{i} = a + bx_{i} + e_{i}$

- Every observation $i$ has an $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$

- The line ( $a + bx_{i}$ ) is our *prediction* for $y_{i}$

- The "residual" $e_{i}$ is the error between actual and predicted $y_{i}$
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 4, out.width = "100%"}
set.seed(123)

lmdata <- tibble(x = rnorm(100, 2, 1),
       y = x + rnorm(100, 0, 1)) %>%
  lm(y ~ x, data = .) %>%
  broom::augment()

ggplot(lmdata, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), color = "maroon") +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = .fitted, ymax = .fitted + .resid),
                 linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "gray") 
```

#  Next week

on Monday: *linear regression*

- How do we estimate a "line of best fit"

on Wednesday: *statistical significance*

- How do we conclude that relationships are "real" or just noise?
