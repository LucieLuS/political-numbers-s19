# Graphics. Why?

--

Is it about lots of info in a *small space*?

--

Lots of info presented in an *intuitive, easily interpreted way*

???

- graphics aren't "always better"; they work alongside text
- focus in on the big idea
- *patterns*
- easy for consumers


---

# Graphics. Why?

```{r why-tab, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "why-tab.png"))
```

???

Table:

- variables describe measure of political interactions with other people
- "social network" doesn't mean online, just in your life
- how big is this political network, how often do you talk about politics, agree vs disagree
- the details of the measures themselves aren't super important. What is important is just the presentation of information.
  - mean, std dev, min and max, number of data points
- How efficiently is it displayed?

# Graphics. Why?

```{r why-fig, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "why-fig.png"))
```

Source: [Kastellec and Leoni (2007)](https://www.princeton.edu/~jkastell/Tables2Graphs/graphs.pdf)

???

Compared to:

- vertical axis we have each of those variables
- Horizontal axis shows the data for each variable
  - dot is mean, solid bar shows standard deviation, dashed lines go to the minimum and maximum
  - N in parentheses

This is a complex graphic, more complex than the canonical graphics that we will talk about today

- but it's a clear demonstration of the value of graphics
- **tables are still good for stuff**
  - exact quantities are important

.pull-left[
```{r anscombe, out.width = "90%"}

"Anscombe's Quartet"

- Four "datasets": sets of $x$ and $y$ variables
- means of $x$ and $y$ are almost identical in every panel
- same correlation in every plot (0.81) and same "line of best fit"

You can calculate these values, but they don't, on their own, mean that you understand your data


<!-- ---

## Know thy data -->


- Anscombe's quartet is an extreme example, but let's look at something more realistic

```{r healy-varying-slopes, out.width = "70%"}

What's the relationship between X and Y?

- If you include S. Africa, there is a really strong relationship
- but S. Africa is skewing the relationship.
- Excluding S. Africa, the relationship is much weaker

Space needs *dimensions* (axes)

# Let's talk about color

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics(here(img, "color-us.png"))
```


???

- color is an accessibility issues
- Color can make a graphic look beautiful, but there's a difference between color for *beauty* and color for *necessity*
- Color for beauty, OK? 
- Graphic shouldn't *need* color
- OR use a colorblindness friendly color palette

- going all the way to zero is often good, but not always
- sometimes it makes it hard to see the important variation

EOs regarding immigration and other rules that controlled the implementation of the Affordable Care Act

- but these actions weren't even technically executive orders, they were agency determinations or agency findings that technically aren't even the same thing
- So this is some misdirection

# Technical lesson: *distributions*

## Good ways to plot distributions

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.5, out.width = "80%"}
distributions <- 
  tibble(x = rnorm(50000)) %>%
  mutate(Histogram = x, 
         `Density Plot` = x) %>%
         # `Box Plot` = x,
         # `Violin Plot` = x) %>%
  gather(key = plot_type, value = xval, -x) %>%
  mutate(plot_type = fct_rev(plot_type))

ggplot(distributions, aes(x = xval)) +
  facet_wrap(~ plot_type, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  geom_histogram(data = filter(distributions, plot_type == "Histogram"),
                 color = "gray20", fill = "gray80") +
  geom_density(data = filter(distributions, plot_type == "Density Plot"),
               color = "gray20", fill = "gray80") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Frequency")
```


---

## Less good ways to plot distributions

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.5, out.width = "60%"}
more_distributions <- 
  tibble(x = rnorm(1000)) %>%
  mutate(`Box Plot` = x,
         `Violin Plot` = x) %>%
  gather(key = plot_type, value = xval, -x) %>%
  mutate(plot_type = fct_relevel(plot_type, "Violin Plot"))


ggplot(more_distributions, aes(x = plot_type, y = xval)) +
  geom_boxplot(data = filter(more_distributions, plot_type == "Box Plot"), 
               color = "gray20", fill = "gray80") +
  geom_violin(data = filter(more_distributions, plot_type == "Violin Plot"), 
              color = "gray20", fill = "gray80") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Value") +
  coord_flip()
```

???

Box plots show "percentiles" of the data

- box is the "inner 50%", from 25th percentile to 75th percentile

Violin plots show a vagina

- relationships
- statistical results

Labels go a long way
