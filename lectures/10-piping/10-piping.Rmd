Data analysis is a series of steps

- think of these steps as being *actions*
- they are *verbs*, things you do, to the data
- You "import" or "read" the data into R
- You "tidy" it, make it so that it has a nice row-column format
  - we will learn about this stuff later on
- Then you sort of have a dialog with the data
  - You transform it, modify variables, calculate summary states
  - you create graphics to visualize your data (for you or for production)
  - This says "model" but it means statistical analysis
  - Models are next week

**Problem is** these steps are cumbersome to type in code, and this process of understanding your data means pushing a lot of data around, modifying it, filtering it, summarizing, and it's all just tedious

---

```{r data}
library("tidyverse")

# COUNTY-level data from Midwest states
midwest
```


```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
midwest %>%
  select(popadults, poptotal) %>%
  mutate(popchildren = poptotal - popadults,
         pr_children = popchildren / poptotal) %>%
  pull(pr_children) %>%
  hist()


mw <- midwest
# as_tibble(EuStockMarkets)
# AirPassengers tidying example
```

???

- Variables for total pop, adult population
- Nothing for children
- Calculate the proportion of the population that is *children* (for every county)
- Then, calculate the mean proportion of children in every state

---


.left-code[
We want to:

- Calculate the proportion of the population that is *children* (for every county)
- Then, calculate the mean proportion of children in every state
]

???

How do we write this code?

- what functions do we use for each step?




---


.left-code[
We want to:

- Calculate the proportion of the population that is *children* (for every county): **mutate()**
- Then, calculate the mean proportion of children in every state: **group_by()** and **summarize()**
]


--

.right-plot[
Overwrite original data at each step?

```{r overwrite}
# all tidyverse functions: first argument is the DATASET

# MUTATE
# first, find the number of children (total minus adults)
# then, find the proportion (children / total)
midwest <- mutate(midwest, 
                  popchildren = poptotal - popadults, 
                  pr_children = popchildren / poptotal)

# group by state
midwest <- group_by(midwest, state)

# mean pr_children by state
summarize(midwest, mean_pr_children = mean(pr_children))
```

]

???

problem is we don't keep the raw data


---


.left-code[
We want to:

- Calculate the proportion of the population that is *children* (for every county): **mutate()**
- Then, calculate the mean proportion of children in every state: **group_by()** and **summarize()**
]


.right-plot[
Create intermediate objects at each step?

```{r intermediates}
# create a new object, 
#   which gets results from mutate()
midwest_mut <- mutate(midwest, 
                      popchildren = poptotal - popadults, 
                      pr_children = popchildren / poptotal)

# group the NEW OBJECT by state
midwest_grp <- group_by(midwest_mut, state)

# Summarize the GROUPED OBJECT
summarize(midwest_grp, mean_pr_children = mean(pr_children))
```
]

???

tedious and inefficient

- Calculate the proportion of the population that is *children* (for every county): **mutate()**
- Then, calculate the mean proportion of children in every state: **group_by()** and **summarize()**
]


.right-plot[
Use the order of operations?

```{r operations}
# every f() creates a new data frame
# so pass results to next function: f(g(h(x)))

# FROM THE INSIDE OUT: mutate() the midwest data
# Then, mutate() result is the data for group_by()
# Then, group_by() result is the data for summarize()

summarize(
  group_by(
    mutate(midwest, 
           popchildren = poptotal - popadults, 
           pr_children = popchildren / poptotal), 
    state), 
  mean_pr_children = mean(pr_children)
)
```
]


???

absolute nightmare

## There's a better way

.left-code[
Linear data processing plan:

- Start with the data, *then*...
- Create new variables, *then*...
- Group the data by state, *then*...
- Calculate the mean in each state
]

--

.right-plot[
Linear code:

```{r pipe-drop}
# enter... the pipe operator %>%
# read it as "and then..."
midwest %>%
  mutate(popchildren = poptotal - popadults,
         pr_children = popchildren / poptotal) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(mean_pr_children = mean(pr_children))
```
]




---

## How it works

.pull-left[
```{r}
# Typical R code: f(data)
dim(midwest)
```
]


--

.pull-right[
```{r}
# with the pipe: data %>% f()
#   data serves as first arg in f()
#   (implicitly)
midwest %>% dim()
```
]


???

**They do the same thing**

- But the pipe lets us write lots of code
- that would be really complicated to write
- in a way that actually is very easy


--

.center[
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Summon the pipe**

Macs: `Cmd + Shift + m`

Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + m`
]






---

## Do lots of things easily

.pull-left[
```{r}
# Typical R code: f(g(x))
#   g() is first, then f()
length(names(midwest))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
# with the pipe: data %>% g() %>% f()
# just as it should be
midwest %>% names() %>% length()
```

```{r}
# or, break across lines for readability
midwest %>% 
  names() %>% 
  length()
```
]

???

This lets you see:

- I start with the data
- then I get the variable names
- then I see how many names there are

This works like the + in ggplot

- You put it at the end of a line to tell R that you aren't done yet


---

## Why we like the pipe operator

.pull-left[
.center[

**Series of operations, without piping**

$f(g(h(x)))$

Works inside-out

Counter-intuitive

Difficult to write

Difficult to read

]
]

.pull-right[
.center[
**With piping**

$x \rightarrow h() \rightarrow g() \rightarrow f()$

Works linearly

Intuitive

Easy to write

Easy to read

*Tidyverse flow*

## Let's write our own chain

1. Start with `midwest`
2. For each state, count metro/non-metro area counties (`inmetro`)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# 1. Start with `midwest`
# 2. For each state, count metro/non-metro area counties (`inmetro`)
midwest %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  count(inmetro)
```


---

## Let's do another

1. Start with `gapminder`
2. For each year, keep the country with the highest GDP per capita
3. sort by year

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# 1. Start with `gapminder`
# 2. For each year, keep the country with the highest GDP per capita
# 3. sort by year
library("gapminder")

gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(year)
```



---

## Printing the results of a chain

```{r}
# results don't print when you make new object
just_WI <- midwest %>%
  filter(state == "WI")

# But they do with print()
just_WI <- midwest %>%
  filter(state == "WI") %>%
  print()
```



---

### When data aren't the first argument?

```{r}
# linear relationship between poverty (y) and education (x)
lm(percelderlypoverty ~ percollege, data = midwest)
```

--

```{r }
# use a period to stand in for the piped data
midwest %>%
  lm(percelderlypoverty ~ percollege, data = .)
```



---

## Tips for pipes

.pull-left[

- Not necessary if just one function

- Break multiple functions across lines

- Indent functions (two spaces)

- Write full chain *before* creating new object

- Test chain line-by-line while writing

- Tidyverse [flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html) by Gina Reynolds

- Need variables out of a data frame? Check out `pull()` or `%$%` from the `magrittr` package

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(here(img, "not-a-pipe.jpg"))
```
