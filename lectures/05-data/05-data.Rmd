# Agenda

Technical lesson: The whole lecture

A "vocabulary" of data tables

Variable "coding"


???

- get us comfortable using the language of data
- get us comfortable with a mental picture of data in our heads

Essay 1

- Variable measuring: How specific? Don't need to talk about specific data sources. I don't need to know what survey you would get voter data from, or what government data you would use to get information on military casualties or something
- Discuss is conceptually. Talk about *possibilities*, not the specifics of a data source

# Setting the scene

???

Data on all countries in the world

- Life expectancy
- GDP per capita
- Total population

# How do you organize data?


???

It lives in my computer, 

- but what format is going to help me
- is it just a text file that has writing in it? No
- Maybe it should live in a spreadsheet, but do you know why it should live in a spread sheet? Do you know why that is useful?
- What kind of language can we use to talk about that spreadsheet? (And other topics of data organization)

## Data tables (a.k.a. "data frames")

```{r, results = 'asis', cache = FALSE}
library("gapminder")
gapminder %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```


(Data from the `gapminder` R package)

???

Let's just get oriented

- Just describe what's in here (without row/column vocab)
- we have country, we know what continent it's in
- it looks like their GDP per capita was (...)

--

Rows are **cases,** a.k.a. "units." What "objects" you studying?

Columns are **variables,** a.k.a. *attributes* or *features* of cases

Cells are **values,** a.k.a. observed measurements of a variable



---

## Data tables are organized by the "unit of observation"

One row per "unit." What is the unit of observation?

```{r, results = 'asis', cache = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```

--

**Unit of observation:** what variable (or combination of variables) *uniquely identifies* cases from one another?


???

- Uniquely identifying cases is extremely important for keeping data organized
- especially if combining data from multiple sources, you need to match information in one table with information in another
- Data may contain "country codes" or "ID numbers"




---

# Variables live in columns

.left-code[
Isolating one variable

```{r vars, results = 'asis', cache = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(continent) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```
]


--

.right-plot[
**Levels**: all possible *values* that a variable could have

```{r secret-recode, echo = FALSE}
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(continent = as.character(continent),
         country = as.character(country))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
unique(gapminder$continent) 
```
]


---

## On so many levels...

--

**Levels of a variable** are possible values taken by a variable

- "We expose our plants to various levels of sunlight"


--

**Levels of measurement** describe information contained in measures

- Nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio

???

- We don't often talk explicitly about levels of measurement
- We are just aware of them because the form of the data affect the types of analysis that you could do
- That's an important point


--

**Level of analysis** means "unit of analysis"

- Individual-level analysis
- State-level analysis
- Cross-national analysis




---

### Benefits of tabular data


.pull-left[

**Calculations.** If $\mathit{GDP \, per \, capita} = \displaystyle\frac{\mathit{GDP}}{\mathit{Pop}}$, find GDP.

```{r, results = "asis"}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  select(-lifeExp, -continent, -year) %>%
  # mutate(gdp = str_c(rep("?", 14  ), collapse = "")) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```

]

???

- Calculations are easy because variables are organized so you can do quick math
-

.pull-right[
**Plotting**. For each unit, variable values serve as $(x, y)$ coordinates.

```{r plot-data, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, out.width = "100%"}
for_plot <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)

ggplot(for_plot, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country == "United States",
                 size = country == "United States",
                 shape = country == "United States",
                 fill = country == "United States"),
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(x) dollar(x, largest_with_cents = 1)) +
  geom_text(data = filter(for_plot, country == "United States"),
            aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                label = "U.S."),
            nudge_y = -3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("FALSE" = secondary, "TRUE" = "white")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FALSE" = secondary, "TRUE" = primary)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("FALSE" = 16, "TRUE" = 21)) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c("FALSE" = 1.5, "TRUE" = 3)) +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (log transformed)",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       caption = str_glue("({unique(for_plot$year)} data only)")) +
  NULL
```

# Data in the computer

# Data in R

.left-code[
```{r gap-intro, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# attach the 'gapminder' package
library("gapminder")

# ...which contains this dataset
gapminder
```

Data can be numeric (`1952`) or text (`"Afghanistan"`)
]

.right-plot[
```{r gap-intro}
```
]


???

- tibble means data table / data frame; it has cases as rows and variables in columns
- Columns have variable names, this is how you refer to the *vector* when you're programming
- there's a label for the data type. Integers (whole numbers), "doubles" (numbers with decimal precision), "factors" (categories that have text labels)


---

## "Coding" and "recoding"

.left-code[
You may encounter categorical data with numeric codes. 

```{r numeric, results = "asis"}
set.seed(5)
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  sample_n(1) %>%
  select(country, continent) %>%
  mutate(`continent (numeric)` = as.numeric(continent)) %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```
]

--

.right-plot[
Consult the "codebook"

```{r codebook}
include_graphics(here(img, "codebook.png"))
```
]


???

What is *recoding*?

- data don't always come in the form you need it
- maybe you want to make a text label, change an existing label,
- collapse a complicated index (strong liberal, liberal, slightly liberal) to be just "liberal"

# Practical advice

class: center, middle

# Practical advice


When "tidying up" your data

When recording "raw" data

$Observed = Truth + Bias + Error$


???

- Tidying: how are rows and columns when collecting new data, modifying existing data
  - rows are cases/units, columns are variables
- Raw data: include as much detail as possible up front
  - my advice, text coding for categorical/qualitative variables
  - You can always convert to numeric later, but starting with specificity and informative labels is good
  - give yourself the option to go simpler, but you can't get more complex once the data are already collected
- Raw data: only the detail that you can justify
  - detail that *you don't have* is noise or bias
